# Soft Tissue / Blood Cells in Dinosaur Fossils (Mary Schweitzer)

## The Argument Goes as Follows

In the early to mid-90s a scientist (Mary Schweitzer) doing research on fossils "cracked open" a dinosaur bone from a t-rex and saw what appeared to be red-blood cells.  Most (all) other scientists agree that soft-tissue, in particular blood, could not survive the 6X,000,000+ years and the fossilization process.

## What Actually Happened

While analyzing fossil remains, Mary Schweitzer, noticed what appeared to be red blood cells in a slice of "dinosaur bone."  Additional experiments seemed to have supported the hypothesis and since then additional experiments on specimens have yielded similar results.

## Key Points

- "Dinosaur bone" is actually a traditional fossil, the bone and soft tissue was a small fraction of the specimen which had not completely fossilized.
- The specimen was a small fragment, it is not as if Mary found a bone, cracked it in half and saw marrow pouring out.
- Some of the strongest evidence supporting that this is actually blood comes from techniques which develop from the predictive capacity of the theory of evolution.

	> When they exposed the cell-like structures to an antibody that targets a protein called PHEX found only in bird osteocytes (birds are descended from dinosaurs), the structures reacted, as would be expected of dinosaur osteocytes.  Update, Oct. 20, 2012, 11:24 a.m.: Mary Schweitzer emailed me to clarify a point that did not come across in her talk. â€œPHEX is actually found in many taxa. However proteins have thousands of antibody binding sites on them. Some antibodies that bind to epitopes shared among groups are broadly cross reactive. Ours, OB 7.3 was selected for only one epitope out of thousands, and that epitope is, so far as it has been tested by the primary researchers, only reactive to osteoctyes from birds. It has been tested against bird osteoblasts, cells on the same lineage as osteocytes, and does not react, and it does not react with osteocytes from non avian taxa tested.
