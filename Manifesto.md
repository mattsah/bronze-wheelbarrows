# How to Convince Me

## My Current Understanding

The Bible was written by men, as men, without divine inspiration or direct information from God.  My interpretation is that they wrote at various times in history, in different oral and literary traditions, and in different manners on different subjects.

I am in agreement with anyone that recognizes the Bible is represented by many genres.  There may be some disagreement as to what those genres are, and exactly what consequences they have.  For example, given my recent study of Ezekial and Isaiah, all the evidence I have gathered seems to indicate that the genre of "prophecy" is not drastically different from history, except in the sense that it is written as something of a political polemic by people with obvious religious bias.  That is to say, Ezekial represents something of a modern Fred Phelps or street preacher if you will condemning his country and countrymen on the basis of his own religious view and perceptions and taking note of the "wrath of God" which is brought upon that nation, and thus, assuming it is because that nation has angered God.  Alternatively, or where his visions are not of retribution, he might be seen as something of a lunatic street preacher who screams about the end times and more fanciful visions, but still driven by what he is seeing around him.

It is extremely difficult to find "hard" prophecy which is specific, or even generalized prophecy which does not become self-fulfilling, i.e. if a Sultan in the Ottoman empire closes up a the eastern gate of Israel *in order to* prevent the messiah from walking through it, because it was written in Ezekial, this is not a "prophecy" but a reaction to writings which people happen to take too seriously.

In this sense, I view the Bible as mostly a combined work of history, philosophy, and mythology.  Examples of mythology may and so far as I can tell likely do include the following:

- Creation Story
- Noah's Flood
- The Exodus
- Old testament legends (Samuel, David v. Goliath, etc)
- The ressurrection and possibly even the entire life of Jesus

While some stories may have historical points of fact, they are predominately set on traditions and stories passed on through the ages, see: Epic of Gilgamesh (Noah's Flood), Horus and Dionysus (Jesus), etc.

## My Current Methodology

Differentiating myth from reality or history is often time the combined work of both biblical scholars and extrabiblical historians.  Archeology may play a role insofar as it can prove or show no evidence of very hard facts like whether or not there was ever a significant population of Israelites in Egypt during the time or even before Moses.  It is, however, in many cases greatly in the realm of science.

There are a number of "faked" evidences such as shroud of Tourin, supposed pieces of the ark, and onward.  It should come as no surprise that these are generally not taken seriously by *most* scientists, so it is often difficult to find serious scientists who would bother to invest time even debunking them.  Frequently, these examples fall on their own.  There have been, for example at least several identifiable claims to have discovered parts of the ark, some conflicting.  "Pictures" from large structures claimed to be the ark show indications that they wouldn't be, i.e. it is doubtful to have cob webs forming at high altitudes in mount Arrarat.

I am willing to examine and take seriously any hard evidence of these and, insofar as I am personally able to, apply my own skepticism and understanding of science to whether or not they are tenable.  I'm also willing to read any peer-reviewed science on the issue, even if it was deemed insufficien, flawed, or simply wrong by its peers.  I'm also willing to take into account the opinions of any scientist who has shown a rudimentary interest in actual science, i.e. not just biblical/creation science and who may have works published on additional topics in their field of interest.

Additionally one must keep in mind the claim that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  If I tell you my cat enjoys eating brocolli, it might be a bit weird, but you may accept it with limited persuasion.  If I tell you that every night at 9 my cat turns into an eagle and flies from my balcony to... you get the point.

I am not willing to waste time on anecdotes, unsupported assertions, scientists who can easily shown to have an agenda or who have no interest in publishing actual data or methodology for peer review.

## On Clarity

If the question is whether or not God exists, we must understand we mean when we say something exists.  We often time talk about things which are not material as existing, like thoughts.  We understand that these may arise from and affect the material world, but not through some mediation.  If the claim is that God exists, one must, in the very least show me how God affects the material world.  Since it is presupposed that he created it, he obviously does not arise or emerge from it.

If it is claimed that God does not affect the material world in any measurable sense, then I don't know in what sense we can speak of him existing.  If it is claimed that God's realm is purely transcendent and there is also a part of me which is transcendent (a soul) then you must show the existence of that part of me which is transcendent.  It is clear why my thoughts exist, despite being immaterial in and of themselves, it is not clear to me that my sould exists.  If you cannot show me how my soul exists, then I don't know in what sense we can speak of it existing.

Thus far, it has been the claim of most of the people I have met that they *can* indeed show me that God exists, and that faith can be seemingly founded and supported through "works."  I have done a significant amount of work already, and although I have not found anything outside of what I expected, I am still open to that possibility or the possibility that I have erred.

## On Evidence

*If*, I am, by the work and dedication of others, shown to be wrong;  *If*, I am, by the work and dedication of others, provided the evidence that God exists.  *If*, I am, by the work and dedication of others, revealed a truth which is as perceptable as the common truths we all share, even if it requires *work*, then I am both interested and willing to accept that truth.

There are, of course, different views on what is acceptable evidence.  This is dependent on many things, not the least of which is the potential to explain the things in question more simply via our naturalistic understanding.  "You don't know how everything was created" is not evidence that God did it any more than the fact that you have never met my mother is not evidence that I was breathed into existenc by a faerie.

Partial evidence or supporting evidence for claims or theories can quauntitatively add up to qualitative belief.  That is, whenever we speak of proof, we speak of proof in terms of that which is enough to convince a person something actually happened or someone/something actually exists, or somehow is how something actually occurred.  This is true in every realm of our understanding.

What you accept as evidence may not be what I accept as evidence.

Recognizing this, it is important for me to point out that what I will accept as evidence depends on exactly what you claim your God did.  If you are indeed claiming that your God created the universe, then I will need at least as much if not more evidence that such is the case than what is currently provided by the best naturalistic explanations.  If your claim is that God created humans and animal kind in (roughly) their current form, then I will need at least as much evidence if not more evidence that such is the case than what is currently provided by the best naturalistic explanations.

## On Proof

In order to shown and have *proven* to me that your God exists, we must examine the claims surrounding your God one by one.  At such a time that the evidence supports your God for any given claim, I will count it as evidence for your God.  At such a time that all claims about and related to your God have had such evidence to bare, I will concede that your God is the more likely answer.

I have noted in some instances, for example, that evidences of certain things would be more convincing.  That is, actual evidence for the bodily ressurrection of Jesus Christ would be a lot more convincing that there is a God, able to suspend and manipulate the laws of nature, than that there is not.  This does not mean that any "evidence" is enough.  There are, of course, conjurers of all sorts historically.  There are, of course, liars and tricksters and mythos.

The question then arises, would such evidence make me believe in your God?  No, not on its own.  While such evidence might make me believe in some God, even a Christian God (in an indefinite sense), the particular claims of your God, your version of the Christian God, still require some evidence.  There is a reason that you are the particular sect of Christian that you are and other reasons that you are not the others.  Catholics, who believe God worked through evolution have far less to prove than evangelicals who believe God made a man from clay and breathed life into him.

If my understanding of the God you claim to exist is correct, then this is a monumental task and it will require no less than the following:

- A refutation of all evidence supporting evolution and an explanation of all the facts evolution currently explains which is consistent with your God.
- A refutation of all evidence supporting big bang cosmology and an explanation of all the facts it currently explains which is consistent with your God.

If in the process of this, you somehow provide a capable refutation of evolution, big bang cosmology, etc, it is important for you to realize that again, you have not proven your God.  That is to say, it may be possible for you to show me that evolution or big bang cosmology doesn't explain life or the universe as we experience it, but you have then, only shown me that these things are *not* the answers.  In order to show me that your God *is* the answer, you will need additional evidence in the affirmative.  Similarly, if in the process, you show me data or facts about the universe or life which are in conflict with evolution or big bang cosmology, you have done nothing to show me that your God does not conflict, or is a more capable and likely explanation.

## What if I'm Wrong

With all of this stated, I honestly do not wish to discourage anyone from their task.  I merely seek to clarify what it would take for you to complete your task as I currently see it.  It takes a lot for me to trust "gut feelings", and it is certainly not possible for me to accept any sort of "truth" which is claimed to require faith.  A truth which requires faith, it seems to me, is a truth in name only and lacks the substance to be a truth in any other sense.

It may be that I will, in this process, become "open to faith."  As such, I recognize the possibility, however small it may be, that I will be convinced in violation of the aforementioned principles and, thus, accept God prematurely.  *If* such a point and time occurs, you can, perhaps accept it as additional evidence of the "power of God."  Indeed, *if* such a point and time occurs, then perhaps I will also accept it as such, but from my current position, I can say that I do not accept this as anything more than self-delusion of an imperfect primate brain which has developed to recognize patterns and associations and to build them along the channels of empathy and anthropomorphization.  This brain has served us very well to survive in the world we live, and indeed, to conquer it in some senses; it has not, thus far, served us well in ridding ourselves of superstition, conspiratorial sympathy, or mysticism.

Regardless of the outcome of our discussions, I welcome the discussion, and the journey for all parties involved.
