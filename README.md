# Bronze Wheelbarrows

A repository aggregating research into creation science.

This respository is designed to collect various arguments and counter arguments against creation science.  This is similar to the iron chariots wiki but with a more specific focus on science.  We accept community contributions which follow the formatting guidelines.

Eventually this content will be used to drive a site with more features.

## General Guidelines

- Articles should be written in markdown
- Articles should be placed in broader directories which allow humans to quickly "index" what is available
- Articles should have concise names which focus on key words

If you fork and submit a pull request, I will either accept or comment as to what needs to be changed in order for it to be accepted or explain why it might not be relevant.  Reasons why an article might not be relevant:

- Does not relate to creation science or arguments which can be refuted scientifically

In short, most articles can be fixed unless they just don't fit the topic.  That said, you should additionally try:

- To keep wording clear
- To provide useful references

## Article Formatting Guidelines

We're not going to be super formal about this, but each article should provide at least four sections:

- The Argument Goes as Follows (an introduction to how the argument is presented often by creationists)
- What Actually Happened (a far less sensational and scientific explanation)
- Key Points (main points to draw from what actually happened)
- References (references which back up what actually happened and offer the complete or more complete story)

Any additional sub-sections you wish to add to these is fine.  You don't need to add specific footnote citations, just point out your references in a bullet list or provide block quotes with a link.
